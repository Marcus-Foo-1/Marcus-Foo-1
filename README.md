**#About Me**

I'm a 23-year-old Software Engineer with close to 2 years of experience, specializing in Java and SQL. In addition to my core expertise, I've worked extensively with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
My professional journey has primarily focused on Card Management Systems (CMS), where I’ve gained deep knowledge in transaction processing and card handling for both acquiring and issuing routing.
My experience in this field has also provided me with a strong understanding of ISO 8583 messaging.

Beyond development, I’ve had the opportunity to engage directly with customers, not just as a developer but as a consultant willing to go the extra mile, including on-site visits to client locations.
This has helped me develop strong problem-solving skills and the ability to communicate technical solutions effectively.
